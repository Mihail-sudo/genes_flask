"10",9,9,"HLA-DPA1","Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading.","P20036","DPA1_HUMAN","HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DP alpha 1 chain (DP(W3)) (DP(W4)) (HLA-SB alpha chain) (MHC class II DP3-alpha) (MHC class II DPA1)","HLA-DPA1 HLA-DP1A HLASB","Homo sapiens (Human)",260,"GO:0009986 GO:0030669 GO:0030666 GO:0010008 GO:0012507 GO:0000139 GO:0071556 GO:0005887 GO:0043231 GO:0005765 GO:0042613 GO:0005886 GO:0032588 GO:0030658 GO:0032395 GO:0042605 GO:0002250 GO:0019886 GO:0071346 GO:0006955 GO:0032729 GO:0050870 GO:0042102","HOIL_FIB","Up"

"33",32,32,"HLA-B","Antigen-presenting major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecule. In complex with B2M/beta 2 microglobulin displays primarily viral and tumor-derived peptides on antigen-presenting cells for recognition by alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) on HLA-B-restricted CD8-positive T cells, guiding antigen-specific T cell immune response to eliminate infected or transformed cells (PubMed:25808313, PubMed:29531227, PubMed:9620674, PubMed:23209413). May also present self-peptides derived from the signal sequence of secreted or membrane proteins, although T cells specific for these peptides are usually inactivated to prevent autoreactivity (PubMed:7743181, PubMed:18991276). Both the peptide and the MHC molecule are recognized by TCR, the peptide is responsible for the fine specificity of antigen recognition and MHC residues account for the MHC restriction of T cells (PubMed:29531227, PubMed:9620674, PubMed:24600035). Typically presents intracellular peptide antigens of 8 to 13 amino acids that arise from cytosolic proteolysis via constitutive proteasome and IFNG-induced immunoproteasome (PubMed:23209413).
